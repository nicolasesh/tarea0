# Example Repository of tarea0

A README.md is like the cover page of our code, like the presentation of our project, like the sugar in your coffe that invites the visitor to stay and clone the repo.

We can do many thing, just like in a jupyter notebook:

1. Enumerate thing
2. Put some links [heatmapping.org](http://heatmapping.org)
3. Etc.

If you want, you can put some code:

	trainer = net.fit(output=score, ground_truth=y_, opt_params=learning_rate)

Or show images:

<img src="doc/tfExecution.png" />

But remember you should **avoid** putting images in your repo, because they are too heavy, limit yourself to have them only for your README.md
